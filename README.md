The Ideal Job Facebook application is a application built using maven, OAuth2 and facebook Graph API. This application is intneded to read statuses of users and make suggestions as to what should have been their ideal profession. This is done by reading their activity and finding keywords related to professions and making posts regarding that. (Since this could reflect one's interests and jobs will be based on them, most likely the app will predict the current job of the user or what the user should have been doing as a job based on the user's interests.)
